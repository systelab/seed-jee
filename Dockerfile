### STAGE 1: Build ###

# We label our stage as 'builder'
FROM maven:alpine as builder


## Storing node modules on a separate layer will prevent unnecessary npm installs at each build
RUN mkdir /seed-jee

WORKDIR /seed-jee

COPY . .

## Build the angular app in production mode and store the artifacts in dist folder
RUN mvn package


### STAGE 2: Setup ###

FROM jboss/wildfly:latest
