# Logging

Wildfly has its own logging subsystem.  The server logging configuration is defined in the standalone.xml (or standalone-full.xml) file.  
By default it includes two handlers; One for logging to the console and another for logging to a file (server.log).

WildFly has its own logging system but it also supports slf4j out-of-the-box.
SLF4J doesnâ€™t provide logging capabilities. It is merely a facade (hence the name) for various logging frameworks, e.g. java.util.logging, log4j and logback, allowing the end user to plug in the desired logging framework at deployment time.

If you want to use a different binding you need to exclude the default logging module 
from being added to your deployment. In order to exclude the Wildfly logging, we have to create a 
jboss-deployment-structure.xml file (src/main/java/resources/META-INF):
(https://stackoverflow.com/questions/38435227/wildfly-disabling-logging-subsystem)
```
    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <jboss-deployment-structure>
        <deployment>
            <exclude-subsystems>
                <subsystem name="logging" />
            </exclude-subsystems>
            <dependencies>
                <module name="org.dom4j"/>
            </dependencies>
        </deployment>
    </jboss-deployment-structure>
```
In pom.xml of our application, we need to add a dependency to slfj4+logback in pom.xml:
```
    <!-- it will pull in the logback-core and slf4j-api -->
    <dependency>
      <groupId>ch.qos.logback</groupId>
      <artifactId>logback-classic</artifactId>
      <version>1.2.3</version>
    </dependency>
```

##Configure Logback logs

The Logback configuration file (logback.xml) must be place in src/main/java/resources.

An example of logback.xml:
```
<configuration>
  <appender name="FILE" class="ch.qos.logback.core.FileAppender">
    <file>./standalone/log/seed_slf4j_logback.log</file>
    <append>true</append>
    <encoder>
      <Pattern>%d{HH:mm} [%thread] %-5level %logger{52} - %msg%n</Pattern>
    </encoder>
  </appender>
  <root>
    <level value="TRACE"/>
    <appender-ref ref="FILE"/>
  </root>
</configuration>
```
